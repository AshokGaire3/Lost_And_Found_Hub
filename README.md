## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (free tier works)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) installed

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd lost-and-found-hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Supabase locally (optional, if running locally)
supabase start

# Apply database migrations
supabase db reset

# Seed sample data (optional but recommended)
supabase migration up

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

The project uses Supabase for authentication and database. To set up:

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your project URL and anon key
3. Create a `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
4. Run migrations:
   ```sh
   # Using Supabase CLI
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   supabase db push
   
   # Or manually apply migrations from supabase/migrations/ in order
   ```

### Sample Data

A migration file is included with 20 sample found items across all categories:

```sh
# Apply all migrations including sample data
supabase migration up
```

This will populate your database with realistic test data for:
- Electronics (iPhones, laptops, AirPods)
- Clothing (jackets, hoodies, coats)
- Keys (car keys, house keys)
- Bags (backpacks, purses)
- Documents (IDs, licenses, cards)
- Books (textbooks, lab manuals)
- Accessories (watches, sunglasses)
- Sports (basketballs, yoga mats)
- Other items
